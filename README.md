# React with TypeScript
- In order to start a project in React with TypeScript use **npx create-react-app my-app --template typescript**
- This is my first project that uses TypeScript in a React project.
- Do not delete "**react-app-env.d.ts**" as it is an important file.
- instead of plain Javascript file extensions, we now have tsx in our project. With the installed dependencies, behind the scenes, React project will automatically compile tsx files and convert them into the js files and then use it in the React project.
- .gitignore file is copied from a Microsoft project.
